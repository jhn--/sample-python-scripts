'''
Note: What if your application is a single script?

You can import any attributes of the script, such as classes, functions, and variables by using the built-in __import__() function. Instead of from my_sum import sum, you can write the following:

target = __import__("my_sum.py")
sum = target.sum
The benefit of using __import__() is that you donâ€™t have to turn your project folder into a package, and you can specify the file name. This is also useful if your filename collides with any standard library packages. For example, math.py would collide with the math module.
